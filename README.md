# Refocus
Hack The North 2020++ Project developed By Catherine He, Vivian Guo, Eric Zhao and Elham Islam

# Function
Refocus is designed to help students stay on task and focus on their lectures through facial and voice recognition. This web app will prompt users when they are not watching their material and serves as a virtual vocal assistant while studying. Our goal is to help students perservere through the struggles of focus and work-management in a remote-learning environment.
 
# Stack
The frontend of the web app is programmed with HTML, CSS, and some javascript with some initial prototyping and mock-ups in Figma for reference.

The main facial tracking components were done by the Tensorflow.js face-API. Retrieving and formatting data found through the facial-detection was done with javascript. The voice-recognition for the lecture aid as well as for the studying assistant was done by implementing the speech-recognition WebKit so that users can make vocal commands and the webApp can identify special keywords.
